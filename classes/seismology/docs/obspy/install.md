# Python Environment

In this class, we will learn to use Obspy to access and analyze seismic waveforms. 

We will use **[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)** to set up the python environment, which comes with many commonly used python packages.

## [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

First, download and install **Anaconda** to your laptop, which can take a while.

## [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

Second, open **jupyter notebook** either in a terminal or from **anaconda navigator**.

## [Obspy](https://docs.obspy.org/)

Third, install **Obspy** using the commands:
```bash
pip install obspy
```
or 
```bash
conda install obspy -c conda-forge
```

## Other packages

- [cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/gallery/index.html) for plotting geospatial data 
```bash
conda install cartopy -c conda-forge
```
