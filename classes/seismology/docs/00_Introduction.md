# Introduction to Observational Seismology
# -- Machine Learning for Seismology

---

# Things to learn in this course

1. Familiarize with basic tasks in seismology
2. Learn the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for solving these seismic tasks
3. Practice processing seismic data, building seismic catalogs, and analyzing seismicity

---

# Why do we study seismology?

- Monitoring earthquakes and mitigate damage

- Understand earthquake source physics

- Understanding the Earth's structure

- Applying seismology to environmental science, planetary science, climate science, etc.

# What do we know about Earthquake rick?

## Think from different time scales

- Before an earthquake
- A few seconds after an earthquake
- days after an earthquake
- years after an earthquake

---

## Before an earthquake

# How can we better monitor earthquakes?

## Instrument

1) Dense seismic networks
2) New sensors, such as Broadband seismometer, nodes, and DAS (Distributed Acoustic Sensing)
3) Remote sensing, LiDAR, etc.

## Algorithm

- Many signal processing algorithms, such as, template matching, cross-correlation, filtering, etc.

- Machine learning, in particular, deep learning
