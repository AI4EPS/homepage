# Introduction to Observational Seismology and Machine Learning

---

# Things to learn in this course

1. Familiarizing with basic tasks in seismology
2. Learning the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for solving seismic problems
3. Practicing processing seismic data, build seismic catalogs, and analyze seismicity

---

# Why do we study seismology?

- Monitoring earthquakes and prevent damage

- Understanding the Earth's structure

---

# What do we know about Earthquake rick?

## Think from different time scales

- Before an earthquake
- A few seconds after an earthquake
- days after an earthquake
- years after an earthquake

---

## Before an earthquake

- Eathquake Hazard Map

# How can we better monitor earthquakes?

## Instrument

1) Dense seismic network
2) New sensors, such nodes and DAS (Distributed Acoustic Sensing)
3) Remote sensing, LiDAR, etc.

## Algorithm

- Machine learning, in particular, deep learning

---

# The advantages of machine learning

Deep Learning (Deep Nerual Networks) is a new paradigm of software development

# Combining seismology and machine learning

* Neural Networks
* Automatic Differentiation
* Optimization
