## Tutorial on GitHub for Machine Learning

### Introduction
In this tutorial, I'll assume you have basic knowledge in **Python, Linear Algebra, and Statistics**. There are many tutorials for different people, and I try to select some of them to give a picture of machine learning. 

### Glossary of Machine Learning--AI 101

Before we learn how to use something, we must know concepts and terms about it. Here I list some glossaries of machine learning:

- [Machine Learning Glossary by Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/)
- [Machine Learning Glossary by ml-glossary](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html)

### Frameworks
The first step to learn machine learning is to learn how to use frameworks, because you must know how to implement your ideas. The most popular framework in academia now is PyTorch. So I'll only list some tutorials for `PyTorch`. There are also some other frameworks, such as `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `Scikit-learn`, etc. `TensorFlow` is still popular in industry, but it's not so popular in academia now. `Keras` is a high-level framework based on `TensorFlow`, so it's easy to learn. `Scikit-learn` is a framework for traditional machine learning, such as SVM, Random Forest, etc. If you want to learn more, you can google them with keywords like `TensorFlow tutorial`.

### Machine Learning

This part is about basic machine learning. There are many machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, SVM, decision tree, etc. I'll list some tutorials about them.

### Deep Learning
This part is about deep learning. Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning. It's based on neural network models. There are many neural network models, such as CNN, RNN, Transformer, GNN, etc. I'll list some tutorials about them.

### Reinforcement Learning

This part is about reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning can be tabular or deep. I'll list some tutorials about them.

### Collections

In this part, I will introduce some collections of different areas in machine learning. It's almost impossible to know all the details of them, but if you are looking for something, just have a try.

### Epilogue

Though I have listed many tutorials, there are actually more on the Internet. The point is not to collect as many resources as possible, or to pick the best ones. It's about starting now and insisting on any one of them. Then you can try to apply what you have learned in real problems. You'll learn more during the process. Good luck!
