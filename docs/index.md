## **News**
[05/2022] I will be joining the Department of Earth & Planetary Science at University of California, Berkeley as an Assistant Professor starting from July 2023. I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students and PostDoc fellows to join my research group. Candidates interested in earthquake science and machine learning are particularly encouraged to apply. 

## **Education**

- Ph.D. Geophysics, Stanford University, 2016-2021
- Ph.D. Minor, Computer Science, Stanford University, 2016-2021
- M.S. Geophysics, Peking University, 2014-2016
- B.S. Geophysics, Peking University, 2009-2013

## **Experience**
- Starting 07/2023, Assistant Professor, University of California, Berkeley
- 10/2021 – Present, Director’s Postdoctoral Fellow, California Institute of Technology
- 06/2019 – 09/2019, Research Intern, Google LLC
- 09/2016 – 06/2021, Graduate Researcher, Stanford University

## **Research**

My research focuses on understanding earthquake physics and statistics by applying cutting-edge artificial intelligence and scientific computing methods to gain new insights from large seismic datasets.

### Machine Learning/Deep Learning for Geophysical Signal Discovery

- Applying deep learning to detecting hidden earthquake signals from large seismic datasets to understand complex earthquake sequences and fault zone structures.
- Applying cloud computing to large-scale data mining to build high-resolution earthquake catalogs for studying earthquake ricks, volcanic activities, glacier evolution, etc.

### Earthquake Simulation and Seismic Inversion for Understanding Earthquake Physics

- Applying earthquake simulation to analyze multiphysics couplings within fault zones such as fluid, permeability, friction, and other mechanical properties.
- Applying automatic differentiation to improve geophysical inversion and constrain key physical parameters such as earthquake source parameters and the Earth’s interior structures.

## **Honors and Awards**
- 2021, Director’s Postdoctoral Fellowship, Caltech Seismological Laboratory 
- 2021, Exceptional Thesis, Geophysics, Stanford University
- 2021, Outstanding Student Presentation Award, American Geophysical Union
